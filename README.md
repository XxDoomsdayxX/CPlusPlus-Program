# CPlusPlus-Program


Project Summary:
This project creates a tool to count how many times different items appear in a list.
It helps organize the data and lets you see it in different ways.


Particularly Well:
The program is organized neatly, so it's easy to understand.
It also handles problems well, like when it can't open the file with the list of items.


Areas for Enhancement:
The program could be improved by giving clearer messages when something goes wrong.
It could also check if you type something wrong in the menu.
Making sure some parts of the program don't change anything by mistake could also help.


Challenging Pieces:
Making the program show the data as a picture (like a bar graph) might have been hard.
Figuring out how to read from and write to files could also be tricky, but the program does it well.


Transferable Skills:
Skills like reading and writing files, organizing data, and making simple menus are useful for many other projects.
Learning how to plan and organize code is also important and can be used in lots of different situations.


Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability:
The code is written neatly and explained with comments, so it's easy to read and understand.
The different parts of the program are separated well, which means if we want to change something, we can do it without breaking the rest of the program.
This makes it easy to update and add new features later on.
